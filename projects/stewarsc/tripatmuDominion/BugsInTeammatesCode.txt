//Bug # 1

ID: Dominion-Adventurer-1-Too many cards added to hand

Severity: Major

Priority: Immediate

Resolution: NOT-FIXED

Status: OPEN

Reproducibility: Every time

Version: Dominion code from CS362 Class Repo (exact version not available)

Description:  
	When the adventurer card is played, the handCount of the game state increases by 1 instead of two. This happens
	after running initializeGame with the following kingdom cards: smithy, adventurer, salvager, remodel, baron, 
	great_hall, ambassador, tribute, outpost, minion, players set to 2, and seed set to 10. In card effect, the adventurer
	card is played, with the three choice variables, handPos and bonus all set to 0. The previously initialized game state
	is also passed to cardEffect. 

	By playing the adventurer card, an extra card is added to the handCount. No error message pops up, and the game plays
	on normally with the wrong values. This is a problem because the adventurer card is supposed to add two cards to your hand, 
	not three. 

	The cause of the bug probably has to do with a loop that is not counted correctly in the part of the code
	where cards are drawn (look for <= instead of < or starting	at 1 instead of 0).

Steps to reproduce:
	Run initializeGame with the input values listed above, and run cardEffect with the values listed above. Check the handCount
	of the current player by running a print statement, and it will be 1 more than it is supposed to be. The bug appears to be 
	an error with counting the amount of cards added to the hand.

Expected Result: 
	handCount should be 7 (two cards added).

Actual Result: 
	handCount is 8 (1 extra card).

//Bug # 2

ID: Dominion-Adventurer-2-Coin count not updated

Severity: Major

Priority: Immediate

Resolution: NOT-FIXED

Status: OPEN

Reproducibility: Every time

Version: Dominion code from CS362 Class Repo (exact version not available)

Description:
	When the adventurer card is played, the coin count is not updated for the current player. This happens
	after running initializeGame with the following kingdom cards: smithy, adventurer, salvager, remodel, baron, 
	great_hall, ambassador, tribute, outpost, minion, players set to 2, and seed set to 10. In card effect, the adventurer
	card is played, with the three choice variables, handPos and bonus all set to 0. The previously initialized game state
	is also passed to cardEffect.

	By playing the adventuer card, the coin count is not updated by two. This is a problem because the adventurer card is supposed to 
	add two treasure cards to a players hand. No error message pops up, and the game plays on normally with the wrong values.

	The cause of the bug probably has to do with not updating the coin value using updateCoins in the adventurer function (updateCoins 
	function not called). Look at adding a call to that function in the adventurer code.

Steps to reproduce:
	Run initializeGame with the input values listed above, and run cardEffect with the values listed above. Check the coins value
	of the current player by running a print statement, and it will be less than it is supposed to be. The bug appears to be an error
	with running the function updateCoin.

Expected Result:
	Coin count should be increased by at least 2. (should be at least 2)

Actual Result: 
	Coin count is increased by less than two. (stays at 0)
